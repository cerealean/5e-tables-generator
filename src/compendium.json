          "Associated with a particular guild, a guild keyrune is a ceremonial, stylized key, about 1 foot long, made from carved stone. Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.",
          "When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the key rune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the Monster Manual for the creature's stat block- the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description- unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this book instead.",
          "The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.",
          "The creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.",
          "Azorius Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a giant eagle for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.",
          "Boros Keyrune (Rare). Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a veteran (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.",
          "Dimir Keyrune (Very Rare). This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an intellect devourer that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it- usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.",
          "Golgari Keyrune (Very Rare). Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a giant scorpion for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.",
          "Gruul Keyrune (Rare). This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and an imal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.",
          "Izzet Keyrune (Rare). Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the galvanice weird (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.",
          "Orzhov Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a winged thrull (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.",
          "Rakdos Keyrune (Uncommon). This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a cackler (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.",
          "Selesnya Keyrune (Rare). Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a dire wolf. The wolf persists for 8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is within 1 mile of you. you can communicate with each other telepathically.",
          "Simic Keyrune (Uncommon). This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of-pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a category 1 krasis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.",

As an added bonus, skyship travel avoids the inherent dangers of a journey by land or sea, and is more readily available than teleportation magic. These beautiful airships range in size but generally are the same size as a merchant coaster. Skyships are held aloft and guided with the help of three or more enchanted crystals called brumestones, which are installed along the hull or topside of the ship. The enchantments required to produce and maintain these brumestones are closely guarded by the Alsfarin Union with in the distant city of Ank'Harel.While the Alsfarin Union occasionally sells skyships to foreign businesses, they retain absolute control over the maintenance of skyships in operation. Skyships are reserved for goods and individuals who want to circumvent the slow speed or danger of an ocean voyage and can afford the exorbitant cost of air travel. No commoner can afford to charter a skyship, and the lower classes of Exandria generally see air travel as just another way for the wealthy elite to lord their superiority over the poor. Others, however, see the majestic craft as aspirational and long to become rich enough to afford one, or skilled enough to pilot one. Port Damali is the only city in Wildemount with an open skyport. The others are in the cities of Ank'Harel, Vasselheim, Emon, and Whitestone. Few skyships in service will deviate from the dedicated shipping routes between these major cities.",

The ritual consumes and destroys the souls of those who are sacrificed, meaning they can't be brought back from the dead.",

Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom.

If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a SO-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing SO until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.",

The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.",

Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin, the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle. The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within, from which up to two Medium creatures can control it-and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.",

The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal, a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter, Lum the Maestro, while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.",

This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.",
          "Controlling the Servant. While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.",

The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.",
          "If the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.",

Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts-left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso-drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.",
          "Destroying the Servant. The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.",

To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.",

Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total).

It was once the horn of her ancient red dragon consort, Ephelomon, that she gave to dragonkind to help them in their war against the giants. The Draakhorn is a signaling device, and it is so large that it requires two Medium creatures (or one Large or larger) to hold it while a third creature sounds it, making the earth resonate to its call. The horn has been blasted with fire into a dark ebony hue and is wrapped in bands of bronze with draconic runes that glow with purple eldritch fire.",
          "The low, moaning drone of the Draakhorn discomfits normal animals within a few miles, and it alerts all dragons within two thousand miles to rise and be wary, for great danger is at hand. Coded blasts were once used to signal specific messages. Knowledge of those codes has been lost to the ages.",

Any character within 20 feet of the entry to the enclosed space must succeed on a DC 12 Strength check to continue pushing against the pressure of the sound. A failure indicates the character can advance no farther toward the entry.",

Success indicates the deafness ends 2 minutes after the Draakhorn ceases to sound. Failure indicates the character remains deafened for 1 hour after the Draakhorn ceases to sound.",

In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability.

By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.",
          "The Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.",
          "Silver Wire. The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an astral projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.",
          "As long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an astral projection's silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.",
          "Any effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.",
          "Summon Monster. When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:",

          "Wish. The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.",
          "Random Properties. There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table (starting on the next page). To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.",

          "Destroying the Machine. The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.",

In recent years, the Simic Combine has extended this research to humanoid subjects, magically transferring the traits of various animals into humans, elves, and vedalken.

              "Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar shape, but there's little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.",
              "Plasmoids don't have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.",
              "When plasmoids sleep, they lose their rigidity and spread out and are thus sometimes mistaken for a rock or some other feature of the environment.",

                "Bards of the College of Satire are called jesters. They use lowbrow stories, daring acrobatics, and cutting jokes to entertain audiences, ranging from the crowds in a rundown dockside pub to the nobles of a king's royal court. Where other bards seek forgotten lore or tales of epic bravery, jesters ferret out embarrassing and hilarious stories of all kinds. Whether telling the ribald tale of a brawny stable hand's affair with an aged duchess or a mocking satire of a paladin of Helm's cloying innocence, a jester never lets taste, social decorum, or shame get in the way of a good laugh.",
                "While jesters are masters of puns, jokes, and verbal barbs, they are much more than just comic relief. They are expected to mock and provoke, taking advantage of how even the most powerful folk are expected by tradition to endure a jester's barbs with good humor. This expectation allows a jester to serve as a critic or a voice of reason when others are too intimidated to speak the truth.",
                "For the duchess with a taste for strapping young laborers, such tales might serve to warn the targets of her affections and force her to change her ways for lack of willing partners. Striking back at the jester only ruins her already damaged reputation, and might provide the best evidence that the jester's satires have hit their mark. But if she is kind and generous to her conquests, the jokes and stories cast her as a kind of folk hero, while drawing even more potential partners to her.",
                "Jesters are loyal to only one cause: the pursuit and propagation of the truth. They use their comedy and innocuous appearance to break down social barriers and expose corruption, incompetence, and stupidity among the rich and powerful. Whether revealing a con artist's treachery or exposing a baron's plans for war as driven by greed and bloodlust, a jester serves as the conscience of a realm.",
                "Jesters adventure to safeguard the common folk and to undermine the plans of the rich, powerful, and arrogant. Their magic bolsters allies' spirits while casting doubt into foes' minds. Among bards, jesters are unmatched acrobats, and their ability to tumble, dodge, leap, and climb makes them slippery opponents in battle.",

Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk.
